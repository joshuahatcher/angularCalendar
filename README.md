# angularCalendar
Simple calendar app created with AngularJS

This calendar is very similar in functionality to my bare-bones JS calendar committed several months ago. I implemented it this time using the AngularJS framework and took the opportunity to clean it up quite a bit, re-architect some things, and consider limited usage of new Date(). In its current state, it displays a clean but unstyled calendar (starting on the current month/year), and has the ability to toggle back or forth to any month in history or the future. I plan to add tests and extra functionality (ability to save notes on given days, etc.) in the near future.
